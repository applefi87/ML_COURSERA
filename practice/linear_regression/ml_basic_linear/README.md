# My ML Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project that predicts outcomes using a linear regression model. The project adheres to best practices in ML workflows, encompassing data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Description
一位隕石的廠商找上了你，他平常做的生意是買低賣高，只要購買克價低於一般隕石販賣克價就能轉賣獲利(就像黃金收購克價低於市價就能轉賣獲利)。
而這陣子發現一種新型隕石，全部被一個集團給挖掘完，他們即將開放競標，但刁難的是每個競標品他們只願提供最大長邊，不願意提供詳細尺寸/克重。

由於沒有克重，無法輕易換算標的值多少錢，廠商希望你幫他建一個模型，當他輸入最大長邊時，估計那個隕石的重量為何以便他競標。

為了統計，你到他的倉庫參觀後，選了396個與新型隕石密度、特徵都相似的一般隕石的各尺寸樣本，並請他量出最長邊並秤重，給你excel檔。
於是，你收到的量完的excel並轉成了csv檔。
開始。

## Data Source
The dataset originates from the US Census Bureau, detailing comprehensive metrics related to California's housing market. The data has undergone a thorough cleaning and preprocessing routine to ensure quality inputs for model training.


## Analysis Workflow
- [ ] Data Loading and Inspection: Read the "housing.csv" data and display summary statistics.
- [ ] Data Preprocessing: Impute missing values and encode categorical variables.
- [ ] Data Splitting: Segregate data into training and testing sets.
- [ ] Feature Standardization: Scale features appropriately.
- [ ] Model Development: Train various regression models.
- [ ] Performance Evaluation: Utilize RMSE for model assessment.
- [ ] Result Visualization: Plot and interpret model performance.
