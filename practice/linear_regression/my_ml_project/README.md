# My ML Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project that predicts outcomes using a linear regression model. The project adheres to best practices in ML workflows, encompassing data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Description

The project applies a linear regression model to predict the relationship between a single independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y). It includes steps such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and making predictions.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_ml_project.git
```
Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
cd my_ml_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Executing program
To train the model, run:

```bash
python src/models/train.py
```
To make predictions with a trained model, run:

```bash
python src/models/predict.py

```

## Help
Any advise for common problems or issues can be found by raising an issue in the repository or consulting the project documentation.

## Data Source
The dataset originates from the US Census Bureau, detailing comprehensive metrics related to California's housing market. The data has undergone a thorough cleaning and preprocessing routine to ensure quality inputs for model training.


## Analysis Workflow
- [ ] Data Loading and Inspection: Read the "housing.csv" data and display summary statistics.
- [ ] Data Preprocessing: Impute missing values and encode categorical variables.
- [ ] Data Splitting: Segregate data into training and testing sets.
- [ ] Feature Standardization: Scale features appropriately.
- [ ] Model Development: Train various regression models.
- [ ] Performance Evaluation: Utilize RMSE for model assessment.
- [ ] Result Visualization: Plot and interpret model performance.
